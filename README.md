      <p>I have shown three different methods above on how to color text; firstly just changing the h1 title style indiviuly, Use of CSS       Selectors to create style elements and finally using a CSS Class to Style Elements. you can do this to multiple elements in one CSS selector demonstrated above, and multiple elements with a CSS class demonstrated below. I have changed the font size of paragraphs, because its pointless doing it to a h element (or so I figured) so I changed the font-family of h4. maybe this is not working because the font is not pre-saved by github... or somthing like that. so im going to check out getting a google font, like explained in the list below. When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font. As I have done with the 'poor story' font, I 'degraded' to 'Open Sans.'</p>
