      <p>I have shown three different methods above on how to color text; firstly just changing the h1 title style indiviuly, Use of CSS       Selectors to create style elements and finally using a CSS Class to Style Elements. you can do this to multiple elements in one CSS selector demonstrated above, and multiple elements with a CSS class demonstrated below. I have changed the font size of paragraphs, because its pointless doing it to a h element (or so I figured) so I changed the font-family of h4. maybe this is not working because the font is not pre-saved by github... or somthing like that. so im going to check out getting a google font, like explained in the list below. When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font. As I have done with the 'poor story' font, I 'degraded' to 'Open Sans.'</p>

    <p>For not knowing staggered coding and section titles, such as heading body and cpation or legend, I have done really well to get an image in, having struggled before on previous repositories. for some reason again the CSS style elements are apearing on preview and are not working... not sure why... I keep trying to find out, but it must be githubs software. I must look for an adequate software to download and begin on (any suggestions?).</p>
    <p> remember you can add more than one class to an element, I chose the image from the free code camp lessons. If my lessons dont cut it they will... boarders around the elements don't seem to work with github on both texts and images. nevertheless note that a border radius set using pixels will likely create ronded edges to your borders or text boxes, note if you use 50% you will create a circle</p>
<p> I will attempt to change background to elements to create what I would call'text boxes'. knowing fine well it probably wont show on a github server.</p>

      <li>Different coding languages are not applicable ?</li>
